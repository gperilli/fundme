# FundMe

A simple stripe payments web app for funding a project through single payments, or subscriptions. Any kind of frontend can be applied here to generate some form of subscription or donation service. Site administration is currently handled with the activeadmin gem, so that signed up users and their subscriptions/donations can be monitored.

### Setting up a Ruby on Rails development environment: General Outline

This is a ruby on rails web app, so first set up a rails development environment on your local machine. If you are using Windows, this will probably involve setting up [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), Windows subsystem for Linux, [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), a ruby environment manager, and Ruby, the language upon which Rails works. Next install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and redis, then you're good to go.

### More Details on Setting Up A Rails Environment on a Linux Machine

#### git: version manager
Install git:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git
```


#### Github CLI: command line interface for Github
Install github CLI:

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0
sudo apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages
sudo apt update
```

Then:
```
sudo apt install -y gh
```

Check the version:
```
gh --version
```

Configure Github CLI

```
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```
Follow the instructions to connect the local Guthub CLI with your Github account.

Confirm Guthub CLI connection with:
```
gh auth status
```
This should display: `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME>`

Configure GIthub CLI with SSH:
```
gh config set git_protocol ssh
```

#### Confugure SSH connection with Github

Generate SSH codes:
```
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "TYPE_YOUR_EMAIL@HERE.com"
```

Give the SSH public key to your Guthub account:
```
gh auth refresh -s write:public_key
```
Run this to set the SSH key locally:
```
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

#### zsh: custom shell
Install imagemagick:
```
sudo apt install -y zsh curl vim imagemagick jq
```

install zsh
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

#### rbenv: ruby version manager
Check if rbenv is installed:
```
rvm implode && sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm
```
The response should be `zsh: command not found: rvm` if it is absent.

Use this to remove previous installation:
```
rm -rf ~/.rbenv
```
install rbenv using git clone:
```
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

configure the shell to load rbenv for Zsh:
```
echo 'eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
rbenv repository details: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-git-checkout


#### Ruby: server side programming language
Install Ruby version 2.7.4:
```
rbenv install 2.7.4
```

Set Ruby 2.7.4 as the gloabl default Ruby version:

```
rbenv global 2.7.4
```

Restart the terminal, and check the installed Ruby version with:
```
ruby -v
```

#### Node: server side Javascript
Install the Node version manager:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.0/install.sh | zsh
```

restart the terminal, then confirm the installed version of Node:
```
nvm -v
```

Install Node version 14.15:
```
nvm install 14.15
```
Confirm the installation of Node:
```
node -v
```

#### Yarn: Javascript package manager
Install yarn:
```
npm install --global yarn
```

Confirm the installed yarn version:
```
yarn -v
```

#### PostgreSQL: Database
Install the PostgreSQL database:
```
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev build-essential
```

#### Redis: key-value store used with Sidekiq for background jobs
Update the local apt package cache:
```
sudo apt update
```
Install Redis:
```
sudo apt install redis-server
```
Configure Redis:
```
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

Set supervised value to `supervised systemd`

Restart the Redis service:
```
sudo systemctl restart redis.service
```

Confirm Redis status:
```
sudo systemctl status redis
```

### Setting Up FundMe for Development
Navigate to the downloaded project files, then do the following to run the web app on a local server:

#### Gems: Ruby packages
Install gems
```
bundle install
```
Install JS packages
```
yarn install
```
Install Rails:
```
gem install rails -v 6.0.3
```

### Confirm that the PostgreSQL databse is running:
In another terminal window:
```
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```
This sholud show something like:

```
postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor pr>
     Active: active (exited) since Mon 2023-10-23 07:59:05 JST; 4h 5min ago
   Main PID: 974 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 1ms
```

The databse server can be started and stopped with:

```
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

```
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```
### Create, migrate, and seed the project databse:
```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

### Create and set the ENV Variables
API keys are required to run this app. In this case [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-jp), for processing dummy/real payments, and [Gmail](https://accounts.google.com/signin), for using your own gmail account to send emails from the Rails mailer. My own private keys are deliberately ignored amongst all the files tracked by git, so please generate your own at Stripe, and Google, and then paste them into your own .env file. The Gmail app password can be generated by going to the security section of your Google account.

Create `.env` file
```
touch .env
```
Inside `.env`, set these variables.
```
PUBLISHABLE_KEY='pk_test_******'
SECRET_KEY='sk_test_*****'
GMAILAPP_PASSWORD='****************'
SIDEKIQ_USERNAME='******'
SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD='******'
```

### Confirm that Redis is running:
```
sudo systemctl status redis
```
Redis can be started and stopped with:
```
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```
```
sudo systemctl stop redis-server
```

### Run Sidekiq to Handle Background Jobs
```
bundle exec sidekiq
```

### Run The Rails Server
Run this command to execute the Rails server, then go to `localhost:3000` to see the running app.
```
rails s
```
